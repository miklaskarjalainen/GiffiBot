# GiffiBot
Is a [UCI](https://www.chessprogramming.org/UCI) chess engine written in Rust.
The main chess logic is imported from the [BitsChess](https://github.com/miklaskarjalainen/BitsChess) repository. This repository purely for the "bot" code.

The bot is currently very much Work In Progress and is very primitive and lacks a lot of features.
